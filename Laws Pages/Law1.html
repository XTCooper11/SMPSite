  <h2>  Section I — Definition of Griefing</h2>
<p>
Griefing is defined as the intentional destruction, removal, or alteration of another player’s property, including but not limited to houses, shops, farms, or other constructed structures.
Minor pranks that cause no lasting structural damage (e.g., temporary blocks, decorations, or harmless traps) are not considered griefing.
</p>
<h2>
Section II — Proportional Retribution
</h2>
<p>
If Player A destroys Player B’s property, then Player B has the legal right to destroy an equivalent property belonging to Player A.
Example: If one house is destroyed, one house of equal or lesser scale may be destroyed in retaliation.
If a shop or store is destroyed, a shop or store of equal or lesser scale may be destroyed in retaliation.
</p>
<h2>
Section III — Lack of Equivalent Property
</h2>
<p>
If the offender (Player A) does not possess property equivalent to that destroyed, the victim (Player B) may:
Burn or dismantle the offender’s residential home in lieu of the destroyed property.
If the offender still lacks sufficient property to equal the destruction caused, Player B may seize or destroy Player A’s possessions, items, and inventory until the balance of damage is met.
</p>
<h2>
Section IV — Multiple Offenses
</h2>
<p>
If multiple properties are destroyed in one or more griefing acts, the victim has the right to:
Destroy or burn a corresponding number of the offender’s properties.
If insufficient property exists to compensate, the victim may seize or destroy the offender’s items, chests, and stored possessions until the balance is satisfied.
</p>
<h2>
Section V — Enforcement & Finality
</h2>
<p>
All retaliatory actions taken under this Act are final, lawful, and not subject to dispute once executed.
No other players may intervene to shield an offender’s property or possessions once they are found guilty of griefing.
Players are strongly encouraged to gather proof (screenshots, witnesses) before executing retaliation to avoid false accusations.
